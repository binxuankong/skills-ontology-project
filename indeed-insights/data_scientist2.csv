Curiox manufactures and sells instruments, automation products, and disposables for cell and protein analysis. The major application of Curiox Laminar Wash™ systems is centrifuge-free sample preparation of cells for Flow Cytometry, Single Cell Genomics, and other emerging cell analysis applications. The Laminar Wash instruments of MINI, HT, and AUTO address unmet needs by enabling affordable, off-the-shelf automation of the current, labor-intensive cell analysis process. Furthermore, the products improve the overall data quality such as cell retention, consistency, and reproducibility. Curiox products are used by customers performing life science research, immunology, immunotherapy, drug discovery diagnostics, vaccine research, and cell therapy research and manufacturing.“There’s this thought among scientists that the only way to prepare suspension cells for analysis is to use centrifugation. Curiox has invented a better way to prepare samples. One that’s good for cells is also good for scientists. We believe sample preparation can be affordable, have a good workflow, be less labor-intensive and reproducible. That’s why we’ve created Laminar Wash technology to help scientists prepare samples in a way that treats their cells gently so as not to introduce further variables into important experiments. If you’re ready to help scientists get better results and break them out of their entrenched ways of sample preparation, Curiox is the right place for you.”Namyong Kim, PhD.

A modern agency process that delivers connected capabilities across Data, Strategy, Technology, Creative and Delivery.We are Digitas. We create Connected Experiences. Where everything connects (a quote from DaVinci). This is important because people feel disconnected. Research has shown that loneliness has gone global. Done right, technology brings us together, such as through a pandemic. Even so, technology has its role in creating a kind of collective anxiety. A sense of something missing. Screen time might be ridding us of ‘boredom’, but it is not freeing our minds to connect creatively. Marketers also struggle to stay in touch, using data in sophisticated ways to execute the same basic advertising. All this leads to a disconnect between brands and people, resulting in an ad-blocked and overloaded world.We pride ourselves on having one of the most innovative strategy teams in the business. Our goal to design the right end-to-end journeys – people are at the centre of everything we do. Data is our fuel.

Consultancy services for innovation grant pilot projects technical monitoring,,Thailand,2020-11-17,"About Asian Disaster Preparedness CenterADPC is an autonomous international organization with a vision to reduce disaster and climate risk impacts on communities and countries in Asia and the Pacific by working with governments, development partners, international organizations, NGOs, civil society, private sector, media, and other key stakeholders. Established in 1986 as a technical capacity building center, ADPC has grown and diversified its expertise across social and physical sciences to support sustainable solutions for risk reduction across a broad range of specialist areas. With over 100 staff from 19 different nationalities and a wide range of professional expertise from atmospheric scientists to social scientists with experiences from all levels of engagement typically required for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Resilience (CR) in an effective manner. ADPC is a competent regional resource center and has seven thematic departments: ADPC Academy, Risk Governance, Climate Resilience, Urban Resilience, Health Risk Management, Preparedness for Response and Recovery, Geospatial Information. These are supported by Finance, Human Resources and Administration, and Strategic Planning departments. In addition to the departments, ADPC works on three cross-cutting themes: Gender and Diversity, Poverty and Livelihoods, and Regional and Transboundary Cooperation through permanent working committees. ADPC Strategy 2020 guides the organization in providing comprehensive risk reduction support to countries and communities in Asia and the Pacific. ADPC recognizes the importance of examining the linkages between disaster risk management, poverty reduction, gender equality, sustainability, rights-based approaches, climate change and regional cooperation. For details please refer to ADPC website at http://www.adpc.net/BackgroundThe World Bank has recently approved the project on Climate Adaptation and Resilience (CARE) in South Asia, a $39.5 million initiative that will be jointly implemented by the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) and the Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System for Africa and Asia (RIMES). The overall aim of the project is to build resilience to climate change risks by sharing regional data and knowledge, developing regional standards and guidelines for infrastructure, and promoting climate-resilient policies and investments. The key target sectors under this project such as agriculture, transport, water, planning, and finance will be piloted in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. ADPC is entrusted for the component 2 focusing on Enabling Climate Resilient Policies and Standards for Development with the following sub-components:Policy and knowledge interventions for climate risk managementSector guidelines and advisory Services on climate resilient design and standardsTechnical Support and Capacity Building to Implement Climate-Risk Management SolutionsInnovation for Climate Adaptation and Resilience The sub-component “Innovation for Climate Adaptation and Resilience” is implemented as part of the World Bank’s Program for Asia Resilience to Climate Change Multi Donor Trust Fund (PARCC TF Grant). This is financed by DFID which will crowdsource innovative and disruptive technology solutions for resilience through grant awards, matchmaking and pilot-testing. This involves a number of actions (e.g. formulation of resilience innovation, call for proposal, judging, award, presentation of results, documentation, and outreach) in phases and is expected to stimulate innovators to explore more climate-smart approaches to development in the region.The resilience innovation is further divided into two categories:Climate Innovation Challenge (CIC) will promote innovation in the South Asia Region (SAR) through award of grants to eligible and qualifying innovators. This would include problem statements around Climate Data and information including short-term EWS and longer-term climate outlook data. The Climate Innovation Challenge will, therefore, aim to facilitate innovative solutions for their application and scale-up across different sectors, and tiers (national, sub-national and local/community) for greater impact.TechEmerge Resilience India Challenge is being undertaken in India in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) as a technical partner with an aim to crowd in private-sector expertise and market-based innovation for resilience through the use of disruptive technologies to address climate and disaster resilience challenges. After a comprehensive needs-assessment, an open global call will be launched to source relevant proven well-tested solutions, that can be customized for the region. With the support of a network of technical advisors, the most relevant innovators will be selected and matched with beneficiary users to adopt and implement local pilot projects and form new partnerships. CARE project will provide grant funding to winning innovators and provide appropriate support for field testing/pilot activities. More details are available on ADPC website.Scope of workADPC is seeking a firm to provide technical support to the two innovation challenges under Component 2.4 and monitor and evaluate technical aspects and implementation of the pilot projects.

Consultant to Do Research on Public Spending for Agriculture in Vietnam for the Period of 1986 – 2020,RLS,Vietnam,2020-12-02,"Term of ReferencesConsultant to do research on Public Spending for Agriculture inVietnam for the period of 1986 – 20201. BackgroundRosa Luxemburg Stiftung (RLS) is one of six major political foundations in the Federal Republic of Germany. Affiliated with the German Left party, Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung nurtures and promotes democratic socialism. We are striving to develop alternative approaches for transforming society toward a more united and just one. With this approach, we are facilitating political analysis, education, and dialogues, both in Germany and worldwide.RLS currently has 26 offices worldwide. In over 80 countries, we are working with partners, including state agencies, academic institutions, and civil society organizations. From RLS Southeast Asia (RLS SEA) – Hanoi Office, we aim to contributing to ensure social, ecological and political rights for all as well as overcoming unequal power structures by promoting participatory decision making processes, political exchange and dialogue, leading to a fair distribution of wealth and resources and a healthy environment. To materialize this goal, we focus on three components including Component A - Social Justice, Component B – Social and Ecological Transformation, and Component C- Raising progressive Mekong voices in the ASEAN region. RLS SEA office in Hanoi is geographically working in five countries - Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand with a broader view into the Southeast Asia region.2. RationalIn 2021 food and agriculture will be at the top of the international political agenda as the UN is planning to hold its highly controversial UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) in September 2021. Many important players in civil society and political movements across the globe fear that the summit will not just provide a stage for “false green revolution solutions” but also compromise and weaken well established institutions such as the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS).In 2020 the Rosa-Luxemburg Food Sovereignty Program has published the study “False Promises: The Alliance for a Green Revolution” to showcase that the “Green Revolution” is not delivering what it promises and even worsens the situation for small-scale producers and other marginalized groups in most of the 13 main focus countries of this initiative. Adding to this activity, the Rosa-Luxemburg Food Sovereignty program wants to utilize the UNFSS as a political momentum and a hook to contribute to the debate around food systems from a left perspective.In order to do so, Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung will publish an analysis on public spending for agriculture in 4 (four) states – we propose Tanzania and Zambia at the African continent and India and Vietnam at the Asian continent and how this spending has developed over time.The working hypotheses are that on the one hand the public spending for agriculture went down – at least at the African continent and only a small number of countries fulfill the Maputo declaration objectives. (This might be different in the Asian countries with a much larger state allocation for the agriculture sector.) On the other hand, we assume a shift towards programs supporting the “Green Revolution” approach. Furthermore, the study wants to qualify public spending on agriculture to orient it towards more progressive food systems. In order to do so the paper will assess qualitatively the agricultural budgets according to 5 (five) dimensions: State sovereignty, Environmental sustainability, Transformation of agricultural systems, Target group small-scale food producers and women, Public research and extension services and use them as a basis to develop policy recommendations. RLS plans to cooperate with partners in the focus countries of this study.In order to contribute the above publication, RLS SEA – Hanoi Office is recruiting one consultant/ a group of consultants to conduct the research on the topic of public spending for agriculture in the last 25 years (1986 – 2020) with detail analysis for period from 2011 to 2020 and how it links to the “Green Revolution” and major Agriculture policies in Vietnam.3. Objectives of the studyThe main objective of the study is to analyse the public spending for agriculture sector in Vietnam and the changes over the period of 25 years and a more detail analysis for period from 2011 to – 2020. These are several sub-objectives as follow:To provide an overall picture of public spending for agriculture sector in the past 25 years.To provide a detailed analysis for the agriculture budgets and provide a rough overview of the overall spending on rural development (it could include direct public investment in infrastructure projects, job creation schemes, construction of regulated market structures for farm produce, etc.)To provide an analysis for Vietnam both on national and regional development strategies and development declarations in the area of agriculture and food and how the country does or does not implement these programs. (For the Southeast Asian context, it could be among others the APEC Policy Partnership on Food Security, the Niigata Declaration on APEC Food Security or its Road Map on Food Security towards 2020, etc.)To identify some of the reasons for the decisions by the state why they have dedicated public funding for certain programs and not others.The in-depth analysis is done in terms of numbers (money available and spent) but also analyses the portfolios and identifies how and for which activities the public money has been spent. The hypotheses are that (1) in many circumstances the agricultural budgets are disproportionately low compared to the overall public budget. (2) Most of the money was spent towards programs supporting the Green Revolution. (3) Financing programs of development cooperation by public and private foreign donors played a key and influential role (and possibly bound public resources of the state own funds). And (4) budgets were oriented towards reducing the diversity of crops through focusing on single crops such as maize or rice and wheat and in some cases qualifying agricultural products for export markets and not towards achieving healthy, diverse and accessible diets (in terms of costs) for local populations (e.g. to fulfil standards set in free trade agreements).Where applicable: The paper will analyse Farmer Input Subsidy Programs (FISP), as more and more money is invested in these programs by many countries. It will explain also what FISP encompass, not just subsidies for seed, fertilizer and pesticides but also related to agricultural infrastructure provided by the state (stock, state purchase, financing models). In addition, there are many donor governments and institutions like the FAO that are setting up similar programs.4. Target Groups of beneficiaries/ readersPolitical decision makers especially in Germany and in the “case countries” but also elsewhereMedia to report more profoundly on UN Food Systems SummitNGOs and other civil society organisations, academics, and researchers in the global North and South to make use of the findings5. Methodology, deliverables and guiding questions for the “case-study chapters”5.1 MethodologyDesk research/ Literature review – evaluating available data regarding public funding in the respective country, analysis of available statistics in a quantitative approach (e.g. Government data, World Bank and others)Qualitative research: Semi-structure interviews and/ or group discussion with different actors such as government representatives, public servants, scientists, civil society organisations, farmer/peasant organisations and affected people on the ground (where appropriate)5.2 Deliverables – Vietnam Case StudyA research report, maximum 13.000 words, in English and VietnameseReport summary (around 1000 words), in English and VietnameseA presentation in power point format, in EnglishScope: the research paper containing the following, but not limited to:An abstract/ summary of the key findings (max 2 pages)Precise answers to the questions and content requested below.A summary of the interviews, highlighting strong quotesAn overview of existing data and budget analysis (exists publicly usually both on national level as well as on international level (World Bank, IFPRI etc.)An analysis and answers to the guiding questions (see below)Provide quantitative data and facts that can be converted to charts and the likeA list of interviewees, including contact details and information whether we can quote a person by name or should treat them anonymouslyProvide trustworthy references (APA format)Where applicable: Photographs that illustrate the main findings of the research and a few information regarding the specific photographs such as: where was it taken, who or what is visible and name of the copyright holderPlease note: the final case studies for the publication will be written by Rosa-Luxemburg-StiftungProposed guiding questionsPlease note: it is crucial that the consultant provides answers to these questions/topics!Very short overview: situation of food and agriculture in the country: hunger figures for the last 25 years (absolute and in relation to the population, absolute number and percentages for women, children and men), poverty figures for the last 25 years (absolute and in relation to the population, absolute number and percentages for women, children and men), role of agricultural sector in terms of employment (distribution according to wage labour, subsistence farming and other), contribution to GDP, areas under agriculture cultivation, import and export of agricultural produce, development of main crops planted over time, population in rural and urban areas and its development over the last 25 years.Public budget for agriculture in the country (including official development assistance from donor governments): How has the agricultural budget changed in the last 25 years? How much money does the agricultural budget receive in absolute figures? What is the percentage of the agricultural budget in relation to the total budget and how has this changed over time? Furthermore, provide a rough overview of the overall spending on rural development in the country which includes direct public investment in infrastructure projects (such as roads, irrigation schemes), job creation schemes, construction of regulated market structures for farm produce, etc.How much money in the agricultural budget is money from donors? How has this developed over time? Can the state itself decide how it wants to spend the donor money or does the money from the donors come with special conditions? For instance, can the money only be used for breeding hybrid seed and not farmers seed, is the money dedicated for promoting cash crops instead of staple crops, etc.How much money from the agricultural budget goes into programs to support the Green Revolution? How has this changed in absolute numbers and in relative terms over the past 25 years? Programs of support are for example: Farmer Input Subsisdy Pograms (FISP), programs or subsidies to promote synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, programs or subsidies to promote hybrid seed or GMOs, establishment of agro dealer networks or other means to distribute the Green Revolution package, public research on hybrid seed. Does the state provide any financial instruments for farmers to support Green Revolution programs? For instance, does the state provide credits? If yes, how does it work? What are the terms? Please note: the consultant should provide a brief overview how all of these programs are working what they do encompass in detail.How are the target groups of development programs defined and reached? Which groups are in fact able to access and benefit from the programs (regional scope, preconditions such as capital availability etc., which classes are considered, which not? How farm units are defined (e.g. small-scale food producers, family farms, commercially viable farms, what about land poor households etc.)What is the share on own staff and resources costs, that remains with the states bureaucracies and extension officers and never reaches the target groups?Is the spending and are programs in line with national and regional development strategies and development declarations in the area of agriculture and food?Agricultural policies in the country: What are the main political initiatives in agriculture, is there any FISP programme in place, any PPPs? Which effects?Are there any longer-term visions or programs of the government for the development of the agricultural sector? Which one?What are some of the reasons for potential shifts in the agriculture budget and for change in focus?What role do external actors play in this? These include donor governments, official development cooperation, the World Bank, IMF and others. Are there any conditions, for example, that development funds can only be used for certain programs to promote the Green Revolution? How far are the development funds still linked to structural adjustment programs? This would de facto limit the sovereignty of states.How far are the agricultural budgets oriented towards fulfilling standards set in trade agreements with the EU or other donor countries?In the opinion of actors from critical civil society, which approaches/programs should the state instead support in order to transform the agricultural sector, both financially and politically?What role can extension services, farmer managed seed, more public research in agriculture and other things play in the transformation?Please note: In order to ensure comparability between the country studies and to be able to make qualitative statements, the respective agricultural budgets are to be classified on the basis of 5 dimensions using different indicators per dimension. The paper must include in these five dimensions below:State sovereignty: can the states themselves decide on the allocation of funds in the agricultural sector, or are any development aid funds tied to certain conditions.Indicator: percentage of agricultural spending in the total of GPD, percentage of agriculture development fund from develop aids. Is there one donor, which provides more than 5% of the total budget?Environmental sustainability: Are public agricultural investments geared towards ensuring environmental sustainability by protecting natural resources and the environment? Development of biodiversity in the fields. Are traditional crops increasingly replaced by a few staple crops such as maize, wheat or rice?Indicators: Share of the agricultural budget for initiatives/programs dedicated to the protection of natural resources and the environment. Share of a crop in the total available agricultural area and its development in the last ten years (2010-2020).Transformation of agricultural systems: Are public investments geared towards transforming agricultural systems by reducing the application of synthetic fertilizers and synthetic pesticides and at the same time improving yields?Indicators: Use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, development of yields for certain staple crops over time.Target group small-scale food producers and focus on women: Are public investments explicitly geared to small-scale food producers and do they focus on women as target group, too?Indicators: changes of number of small-scale farmers during the period of research, niche market for small-scale farmer, climate-smart agriculture. Proportion of programs that explicitly identify small-scale food producers as target groups. In contrast to programs that target commercial farmers or larger farms. Proportion of programs that explicitly identify women as target group.Public research and extension services: Are public investments designed to promote public funded research and extension services.Indicators: Share of the agricultural budget for public research and extension services.6.

Individuals from minority groups, indigenous groups and persons with disabilities are equally encouraged to apply. All applications will be treated with the strictest confidence.UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.BackgroundProject TitleKedu Lab for COVID-19, UNDP PhilippinesProject DescriptionThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was officially declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 as it affected more than 110 countries and territories. Its rapid spread is causing negative impacts on health systems and economies around the world. As of 5 July 2020, there have been more than 31,000 active cases of COVID-19 individuals in the Philippines.COVID-19 has already shown its socio-economic impacts as the weeks under ECQ progressed, with the lockdown restricting movement, productivity, and trade. The vulnerable and marginalized sectors have suffered the most, as without a daily income for subsistence, must now rely on the social amelioration package prepared by government. While the government has taken a hard-lined stance to instill law and order, its policy decisions and response strategies will need to be supported with evidence. There is already a need to prepare for the recovery phase, which must balance the need to restart economic activity with the need to contain the rate of infection. The issue, however, is the fact that critical sources of data are still fragmented across technical solutions, databases, public and private organizations. There is no central platform that is able to capture the critical sources of data to give a holistic picture of the situation - taking into account not just health but also socioeconomic considerations - for the IATF and local governments.With this, UNDP Philippines aims to establish a knowledge centre and platform for the COVID-19 response, through convening of a COVID-19 Pintig Lab, that will provide real time data driven policy recommendations to national and local governments. Specifically, the Pintig Lab will provide a data warehouse that will combine data sources from multiple systems, process available data, and conduct advanced qualitative and quantitative analysis to provide real time information and a comprehensive set of policy recommendations to decision-makers.With the Pintig Lab having already established itself at the national level, there is now a need to lay the foundations for a satellite data lab of Pintig in BARMM, named the ‘COVID-19 Kedu Lab.’ In this regard, UNDP is looking for a Project Coordinator who will be based in BARMM for COVID-19 Kedu Lab who shall lead the PMO in the coordination of data-related initiatives to support the BARMM COVID-19 response and recovery strategy with the point-persons in BARMM, including government officials, UNDP staff, and other partners or stakeholders.The Project Coordinator will ensure not only effective day-to-day operations in BARMM but also strategic leadership and innovation, s/he will also lead the project’s efforts to boost the quality, usefulness and project impact of the COVID-19 Kedu Lab and build the Regional Government agencies/units, LGUs and CSOs competencies to support e-Governance in BARMM.S/he is expected to analyze and interpret the UNDP’s financial rules and regulations and other corporate policies and processes on project and procurement management to accelerate the delivery of outputs.
