"Manager, Donor Data & Analytics",The Obama Foundation,USA,2020-04-10,"--------------------------About the Obama Foundation--------------------------At the Obama Foundation, we are guided by a core belief: that ordinary people working together can change history. Our mission is to inspire those people to take action, empower them to change their world for the better, and connect them so they can achieve more together than they can alone.That approach begins at home, on the South Side of Chicago, where we are building the Obama Presidential Center (OPC). The Center represents a historic opportunity for Chicago: a chance to build a world-class museum and public gathering space that celebrates our nation's first African American President and First Lady, steps away from where he began his career, where she was raised, and where—together—they made their home. But that approach extends to all our work, whether it's holding leadership training sessions in communities throughout the U.S., bringing local leaders together in countries around the world, working to support the global education of girls, or ensuring young men of color have pathways to opportunity.As we advance in our programmatic initiatives and move closer to the actualization of the OPC, we are investing heavily in fundraising and development talent that can serve as drivers of our mission-critical work. The key to success in these roles is a commitment to philanthropic excellence and leveraging our community-at-large to support our cause in transformational ways.

Our UXA department is comprised of UXA’s, Business Analysts (BA) and Quality Assurance (QA) Testers. The UXA Manager will manage the growing department and also work independently on projects. The main goal of the department is to help our clients solve complex business problems by defining custom, quality digital products.The department independently runs a project’s discovery process and creates the required deliverables to document discovery findings in a modified agile environment for custom software applications. The main deliverable of the discovery process is a set of documents written by the UXA or BA to illustrate the solution to the client as well as serve as the blueprint for what to build by the development team.The candidate should have a minimum of 10 years experience in UX/BA and be well versed in managing team members of all levels in a growing department that strives for scalability and efficiency. Experience in managing 3 or more direct reports is a plus. The candidate should be an expert in creating documentation/deliverables for custom software applications in an agile environment for use by developers and client approvals - experience moving from traditional waterfall to agile a plus.Within projects the UXA can fill many roles at Orases that will vary from project to project depending on the client's needs. The UXA Manager candidate should have a passion for, or willingness to embrace the following roles:Information Architect: define system organization and navigation, determine project and product vocabulary, labeling system navigation and controls, determine the hierarchy of information on specific screens, etc.Business Analyst: help define the product goals and objectives; define business rules as they relate to/impact the client's product; learn a client's business and help define more efficient processes that can be automated by the client's product; etc.User Experience Researcher/Advocate: define user types and actions; knowledgeable about user centric design principles and best practices; be a constant advocate for the end user; plan and conduct user research and testing; etc.Quality Assurance Tester: ensure a product meets expected results verified by discovery deliverables, ensure product output adheres to approved design and works, perform browser and device testing on product, clearly and concisely communicate issues, create and execute test plans, etc.User Interface Designer: determine best interface that meets user needs and business requirements as efficiently as possible; work with design systems/templates to create prototypes and wireframes; assist graphic designers in creating site designs that meet requirements and serve users; etc.The UXA should also have the following skills/mindsets:Great Listener: you will be interviewing stakeholders and users from all types of businesses to learn about their organization and how we can help them. These communications become the basis for what we will build and it's important to be a great listener.A Clear Communicator: you will need to be a clear communicator, whether it's in writing (e.g. project briefs, requirements, microcopy, Basecamp messages), in person, or via the deliverables you create (e.g. wireframes, workflows) to demonstrate the proposed solutions. You must be comfortable presenting to stakeholders and internal team members. Always setting the right context for what you are presenting and using storytelling techniques are key elements to a successful UXA.Problem Solver: you are able to come up with solutions that meet the user's needs, client’s business rules, conform to technical constraints or external requirements, and are within the client's timeline and budget.Autodidact: you’re always wanting to learn and refine your craft.

Our team looks to the UXAs to guide the way even when it can be a bit murky.Autonomous: Orases values autonomy in all our team members and the UXA is no exception.

Community Manager,Comfort Works,Malaysia,2021-01-04,"We’re looking to hire a Community Manager to join us at Comfort Works to work on all sorts of fun, meaningful marketing projects. We’re accepting applications for the next 2 weeks with a start date of early February.About the role and the work:We are looking for a high energy community and social media specialist to join our Marketing team in our KL Headquarters. You will be responsible for creating engagement, building the super fan community, and boosting brand awareness on all our social media platforms. This is a position that requires humor, resourcefulness, grace, fast reflexes, patience, and empathy. You understand that “on the Internet”, nothing is truly deleted so we try to put our best foot forward, always.This role is for someone who is excited to work with Customer Experience Agents, Marketers, Product Managers, and Data Specialists to deep dive into customer personas & behaviors in order to build on content strategy and generate inbound traffic. You will need to be enthusiastic, curious, and organized, as your responsibilities will include customer and community research, image selection, writing, and social media management. You will be expected to manage our social presence and to create new social community channels like Reddit. You will also be expected to chat, call, or hang out where our customers are hanging out so that you gain a deeper understanding of who you are creating content and building communities for. Because you will be so visible (virtually, anyway) you will be held to high standards.This position is an opportunity for someone who is eager to learn and grow in their career. Someone who proactively reaches out to groups, organizations, other brands we should be partnering with and fielding sponsorship opportunities that come our way. It's built for someone who is able to recognize an opportunity when they see one, able to make a business case to get buy-ins from stakeholders but knows how to steer clear of high effort low reward mirages. Someone who is able to keep an eye on the analytics and measure the effectiveness of the user-generated content. Someone who is able to marry the impact of the community to the organization's goals. If you do not know how yet, we will be here to coach you.In addition to big picture strategy and community engagement, you’ll be working on practical day-to-day work like responding to comments and customer queries in a timely manner. We value efficiency, conscientiousness, and creativity. You will be expected to monitor and engage with customers on online review sites. We don’t simply take problems “offline”, we are a team that lives to truly resolve people’s issues and concerns. You will be working closely with the Customer Experience team by escalating and resolving product and service problems, creating new products or processes along the way.About you:You’re creative. You’re organized. You’re experienced.You love our brand and what we stand for.You have a love for writing, a passion for storytelling and concept creation, a soft spot for interior design, and a fascination with technology. You have a great eye for design and are aware of and follow other tastemakers and influencers. You are not afraid of data and analytics. You are hungry, humble, and human smart. You value quality and consistency when it comes to working. You’re most likely a cat person.You are known for your humor and empathy- even through tough complex human problems. We value people who can take a stand yet commit to kindness even when they disagree. And understand the value of others being heard. Charging the trust battery between us and our community is part of the work. And it's part of our culture of mutual trust and respect. You may also have a stack of design, food, and travel blogs/ Pinterest boards/ Twitter accounts you’re just dying for us to check out too. We’re hoping you also have completely unrelated hobbies that will make us love you even more.About us:Comfort Works is challenging the upholstery industry on a global scale. We are privately owned and never had outside funding, so we don’t answer to anyone by ourselves and our customers.We’re committed generalists, conscientious workers, and believers in doing what's right and what's essential. No heroics. This job is not about moving heaven and earth. Yes, we want to be proud of running a globally competitive business (our business continues to grow even in a pandemic) but we also want to be kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. Especially in a crisis. We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Our team is 50% Malaysians and 50% Expats. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company.We are quick to trust.

We show up for the work and for each other. You can expect a team that listens and for you to be heard. You can expect to grow in your strengths, versatility, and competence in this job. You can expect an inclusive, eager team who’ll support you in it, rise to challenges with you and grow together. We subject ideas to rigorous consideration and challenge each other, but all remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. We’re in this for the long haul.Comfort Works is based in Damansara Heights. We work from a house, not an office. We are semi-remote mainly because we believe in having face-to-face reviews, retrospectives, and refinements while intentionally setting aside “alone time” to excel in your own work. We’re all about reasonable working hours, ample flexible vacation time, wellness, education, and putting humans before policies first.
