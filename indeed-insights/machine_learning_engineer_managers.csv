Diversity Program Manager,Triplebyte,USA,2020-04-23,"About TriplebyteTriplebyte is transforming the way software engineers are hired. Our mission is to build an open, valuable and skills-based credential for all engineers. This is important because millions of people have skills (and deserve good jobs), but don’t fit the profile that recruiters seek. Another way of saying this is that talent is uniformly distributed, but opportunity is not. Our goal is to broaden the distribution of opportunity.To do this, we have built a background-blind technical assessment and interview process, and we use it to find engineers and help them get jobs at 450+ top companies. Our rich understanding of candidates’ skills and propriety machine learning models enable us to find the right match between our candidates and partner companies. This is why companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte’s technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.We just raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 65 is growing quickly!

Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

Product Manager,Afresh,USA,2020-04-10,"Be apart of an incredible and impactful product!The fresh, perishable food industry is massive and growing faster than the packaged consumer goods industry. But, to date, most supply chain technologies have been built for non-perishable goods. This technology gap results in suboptimal decision making-causing billions of dollars of excess food purchasing and waste every yearSo we built Afresh (http://afreshtechnologies.com/) with a simple argument: a supply chain company, built specifically for fresh food and using the cutting edge of technology could massively reduce food waste, make nutritious food more accessible, and multiply the profitability of food companies at the same time.We’ve grown fast. In our deployments with large grocery chains we have reduced food waste by 25-40% and massively boosted customer profits! Our system is now live with several large regional grocers representing hundreds of stores and billions of revenue.

In the US, about 40% of all food waste occurs at the retail level and downstream, largely driven by insufficient technology and manual processes.Afresh seeks to tackle some of these big problems around food waste. Born out of Stanford's Computer Science PhD program, Afresh is the first Fresh food supply chain company. We bring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence to Fresh food to minimize food waste.Our machine learning-powered supply chain solutions are tailored for the many nuances and complexities of perishables. Our first product is a store-level replenishment tool that optimizes the ordering of items in fresh categories - produce, meat, deli, dairy, bakery, and prepared foods. The goal is to minimize waste and maximize in-stock rate, and consequently, profit.So far, our results are in line with that goal! Our technology is deployed across the country and used every day—our customers have reduced their food waste by 33-50%+ and significantly improved their profits.We're growing fast: we're in partnership with several large regional grocers representing 500+ stores and >$10B in revenue.

Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally.

"Product Manager, Communications",Axon,Vietnam,2021-04-01,"Our mission is to protect life.We're out to make the world a safer place by solving big problems and taking on the public safety challenges of our time. From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities. We'll put video at the heart of police records so our justice system can get to the truth faster. And we won't stop innovating until the bullet is rendered obsolete.It's a big mission, but it's one we'll pursue relentlessly every single day.Location: Ho Chi Minh cityReal Time Communications in Public SafetyWhile enterprise collaboration has experienced a sea change in the past 10 years (think Zoom, Slack, and a bevy of role and domain-specific tools), public safety has largely been left behind. Though police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical services personnel put themselves in harm's way on a daily basis, their ability to communicate and coordinate is hampered by disjointed systems, arcane user interfaces, and technology that was implemented before (and without) modern product design and technology. The news is full of examples of first responders lacking critical information, which leads to less-than-ideal outcomes.Axon is in a unique position to address this problem. As the largest provider of de-escalation training and the creator of the world's first LTE-connected body camera, we are leading the charge to connect first responders, enable them to make more intelligent decisions, and ultimately save more lives. To that end, the Real Time Communications team is creating a new product category that integrates voice, text, and video communications into a lightning-fast collaboration toolset. Like all teams at Axon, we value transparency and bias for action, and are looking for talented people from all backgrounds to join us in pulling the future forward into today.Your ImpactYou will lead the design and engineering effort to scale Axon's dispatch solution from our initial set of customers to thousands. There are more than 18,000 police departments in the United States alone, and many more globally. They all are unique in some way, yet our solution needs to be easy to deploy, configure, and manage.
